**What are we looking for?**

First, your code will be reviewed on simplicity and readability. We want all our engineers to write code that can be understood and extended easily, so being able to grok your work is very important.  
We will also look at your coding style, use of data structures, how your UI looks and performs, and overall platform knowledge.  
Your code should work and thoroughly solve the problem. It should cover the correct cases, edge cases and error cases. 
Your code should use your chosen language to its fullest capacity.  
It’s up to you to impress us with this assignment. The list of products can be a simple or as fancy as you’d like it to be. 

**How do I return my completed problem?**

Preferred: GitHub.  
Alternate: Include your work attached as an archive.  
Email me back.  

**How long should it take?**

This is going to vary quite a bit depending on how much detail you put in and your abilities as an engineer.  
We don’t typically have a deadline with this challenge, but most complete it within a few days.  
If you need more time, take it. It will not reflect negatively on you if you have other competing priorities.
